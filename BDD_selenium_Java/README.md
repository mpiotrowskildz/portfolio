## Practising BDD/Cucumber/Selenium/Java
This repository includes all my attempts at automating tests using Selenium WebDriver using [this setup](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton).  
My first try is automating [the herokuapp login page](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login). The [login.feature](/src/test/resources/io/cucumber/skeleton/login.feature) includes a scenario outline for:  
- correct logging in,
- incorrect logging in using a wrong password.

In the future I hope to work on more projects!
