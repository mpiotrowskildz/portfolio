## Exploratory tests
I conducted exploratory tests using Xray Exploratory App. In my first test, I looked at general functionality, usability and layout of the app as specified in the documentation.  
You will find the report in the pdf version in this directory. Furthermore, I also uploaded a whole zip folder containing the report, my notes, screenshot and a video as well.  
Also, you might download the Basic_features_usability.test file to see the whole session.
