## Mr Buggy 3 project
This project's aim is to:
1. present the way I analyse documents;
2. form requirements, which become the test basis;
3. prepare test cases (they were created using TestRail);
4. report defects (reports were created using Jira) and test results;
5. conduct exploratory tests (using Xray Exploratory App);
