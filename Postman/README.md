## Postman
To show my skills with REST API, I've used Postman to make some basic requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) on [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/), which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/bNZhNzQdV9Q).
I added a [JSON file](/portfolio/Postman/Restful%20Booker.postman_collection.json) with my collection as well.
