## Postman
To show my skills with REST API, I've used Postman to make some basic requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) on <a href="https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com" targer="_blank">Restful Booker</a>, which you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/bNZhNzQdV9Q" target="_blank">here</a>.
I added a [JSON file](/portfolio/Postman/Restful%20Booker.postman_collection.json) with my collection as well.
