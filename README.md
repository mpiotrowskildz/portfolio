# My portfolio
This repo is supposed to show my testing skills and present the tools that I have used.  
[BDD_selenium_Java](https://github.com/mpiotrowskildz/portfolio/tree/main/BDD_selenium_Java) is my attempt at automating BDD scripts using Cucumber, Java and Selenium WebDriver. With time, I will add more of my work there.  
[Postman](https://github.com/mpiotrowskildz/portfolio/tree/main/Postman) is a modest collection of my requests. Please go to the readme file as it includes a link to a YouTube presentation.  
[Selenium_IDE](https://github.com/mpiotrowskildz/portfolio/tree/main/Selenium_IDE) is aimed at showing how I use this tool for automating some simple test. Similarly to Postman section, the readme file also includes a YouTube presentation.
